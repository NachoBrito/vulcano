# System Patterns: RAG Frontend

## Architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) to keep it lightweight.
- **Vite**: Used for development server, dependency management, and resource compaction (bundling).
- **Component-based Structure**: Organizing code into functional modules despite not using a framework.

## Key Decisions
- Use ESM (ES Modules) for modularity.
- Implement a simple state management pattern if needed.
- CSS-in-JS or plain CSS with modern features (variables, nesting).
