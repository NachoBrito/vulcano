# Active Context

## Current work focus
Initializing the memory bank by creating and populating core documentation files.

## Recent changes
- Created `productContext.md`.

## Next steps
- Create remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Read all created memory bank files to establish initial context.
- Summarize the initial memory bank content.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensure all core memory bank files are present and contain relevant initial information.
- The initial content for these files is derived from the `projectbrief.md` and general understanding of a database project.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Adhere to the established memory bank structure and content guidelines.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project is a vector database, so documentation should reflect this focus.
