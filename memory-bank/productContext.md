# Product Context

## Why this project exists
VulcanoDB aims to provide a high-performance, scalable solution for managing and querying vector data, which is increasingly vital for AI, machine learning, and semantic search applications.

## Problems it solves
- **Inefficient vector search**: Traditional databases are not optimized for similarity search on high-dimensional vector data.
- **Complex data management**: Simplifies the storage and retrieval of document-based data with diverse field types.
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Addresses latency issues with multi-threaded execution and advanced indexing.

## How it should work
Users should be able to:
- Store documents containing various data types, including vectors.
- Perform fast vector similarity searches using HNSW indexing.
- Execute complex queries efficiently.
- Scale their data storage and query capabilities.

## User experience goals
- **Ease of use**: Provide intuitive APIs for data interaction.
- **High performance**: Ensure fast query response times.
- **Reliability**: Guarantee data integrity and system stability.
- **Flexibility**: Support a wide range of use cases and data models.
