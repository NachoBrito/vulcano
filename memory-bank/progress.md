# Progress

## What works
- Initial project setup and core modules are in place as per `projectbrief.md`.
- Basic document storage and retrieval mechanisms are expected to be functional (based on project description).
- HNSW indexing is integrated for vector search capabilities.

## What's left to build
- Detailed implementation of query compilation and optimization.
- Robust error handling and fault tolerance across modules.
- Comprehensive performance tuning and benchmarking.
- Production-ready MCP module with secure communication.
- Advanced administrative and monitoring features.

## Current status
- The project is in an early to mid-development stage, with core features implemented but requiring further refinement and expansion.
- Memory bank initialization is currently in progress.

## Known issues
- Performance might not be fully optimized in all scenarios.
- Scalability under extreme loads needs thorough testing.

## Evolution of project decisions
- Initial focus on core database functionality and HNSW indexing.
- Future iterations will likely expand on query capabilities, distributed architecture, and advanced features.
