        Vulcano (Sicilian: Vurcanu) or Vulcan is a small volcanic island belonging to Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea, 
        about 20 km (12 mi) north of Sicily and located at the southernmost end of the seven Aeolian Islands.
        The island is known for its volcanic activity and contains several volcanic calderas, including one of the 
        four active volcanoes in Italy that are not submarine. The English word "volcano", and its equivalent in
        several European languages, derives from the name of this island, which derives from the Roman belief that 
        the tiny island was the chimney of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. In November 2021, 150 people were evacuated 
        from the island's harbour area due to increased volcanic activity and gases; an amber alert had been issued 
        in October 2021 after several significant changes in the volcano's parameters.[2]. In the fall of 2025, 
        volcanic unrest increased again with strong gas emissions reported on October 15, 2025.[3]

        In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a 
        database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database 
        itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to 
        administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be 
        referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, 
        the database system or an application associated with the database.
